1. Read and sort letters
Design an algorithm that will prompt the user for three letters, receive those letters as input, sort them into ascending sequence
 and display them to the monitor
 
 input
 letter 1
 letter 2
 letter 3
 
 process
 prompt to enter three letters
 sort the letters in ascending order
 display the letters in ascending orders
 
 output
 three letters in ascending sequence
 
 psedocode
 enter three letters 
 sort the letters in ascending order
 display the letters in ascending orders
 print three letters in ascending sequence.
 
2. Process customer record
A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 
The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
    0  tax exempt (0%)
    1  state sales tax only (3%)
    2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
    3  special sales tax (7%)
The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,and print the customer’s name, 
purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.

inputs
customer_name
purchase_amount
tax_code

outputs
customer_name
purchase_amount
sales_tax
total_amount_due

processing steps
read customer_name, purchase_amount, tax_code

set taxcode_percent = 0
if tax_code = 1 then
tax_code percent = 3
else if tax_code = 2 then
tax_code percent = 5
else if tax_code = 3 then
tax_code percent = 7

pseducode
read customer_name, purchase_amount, tax_code
set taxcode_percent = 0
if tax_code = 1 then
tax_code percent = 3
else if tax_code = 2 then
tax_code percent = 5
else if tax_code = 3 then
tax_code percent = 7
display customer_name, purchase_amount, sales_tax, tax_code

3. Calculate employee's pay
A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, pay rate and the
 number of hours worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field 
 and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee’s weekly pay and then print it and the input data.

Validation: According to the company’s rules, the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, and
 the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. If the hours worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range, 
 the input data and an appropriate message are to be printed and the employee’s weekly pay is not to be calculated.

Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated at time-and-a-half.

input
employee number
maximum hours an employee can work
maximum hourly  pay rate

output
 output employee's weekly pay

processing
get pay_rate, hours_rate
if hours _worked >60 or pay_rate > 25 then
print "Employee can not work"
else if hours_worked > 35 then
overtime = hours worked - 35
total_pay = ( 35 * pay_rate) + ( overtime * pay_rate * 1.5)
else  
total _pay = hours worked *pay_rate


psedocode
read employee number, maximum hours an emplotee work and maximum hourly pay rate
set maximum hours an employee can work = 60
set maximum hourly rate = 25
if hours _worked >60 or pay_rate > 25 then
print "Employee can not work"
else if hours_worked > 35 then
overtime = hours worked - 35
total_pay = ( 35 * pay_rate) + ( overtime * pay_rate * 1.5)
else  
total _pay = hours worked *pay_rate
print employee's number, pay rate, number of ours worked, weekly total_pay
